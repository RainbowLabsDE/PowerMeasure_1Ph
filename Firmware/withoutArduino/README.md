# StripController Firmware
This folder contains the firmware for the CH32V003 MCU for the StripController PCB.

It's a MounRiver IDE project (as it's the first project I'm doing with the CH32) and will likely be ported to a more comfortable toolchain later.  
Currently I'm simply using VSCode for the actual coding and only switch to MounRiver for uploading.
